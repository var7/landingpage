<br/>

I'm a 20-year-old IT Engineer from Hyderbad, India. I will be graduating from <a href="http://www.cbit.ac.in" target="_blank">CBIT</a> in 2016 with a degree in Information Technology.

<br/>

I'm learning Python. I'm familiar with Java and C. I've been on a mission to do some code everyday, for the past month. I use a Mac and an Android (total Android junkie). I think of myself as a minimalist. "Design is not just what it looks like, but how it works"  - *Steve Jobs*, is a mantra I try to enforce in all things I do. 

<br/>

My favorite color is red (combination is red and black). I love <a href="https://www.facebook.com/var7photography" target="_blank">photography</a>. It's one of my passions, the other being Golf. I hold a 9 handicap and play at the <a href="http://www.hyderabadgolfclub.co.in/HGA/Hyderabad_Golf_Club_Home.html" target="_blank">Hyderabad Golf Club</a>. Any sport is game, and I love playing Cricket and Football as well. I'm a book-worm and my favorite genre is Fantasy. I'm currently reading the *Wheel of Time* series by *Robert Jordan*. 

<br/>

I want to make the world a better place for future generations to come.
