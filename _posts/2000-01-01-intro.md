<br/>

I'm 20 years old, studying for my Bachelor's in Engineering from Hyderabad, India. I will be graduating in 2016 from CBIT, Osmania University. My primary interest is in the Design and Analysis of Algorithms.

<br/>

Currently am learning Python, also familiar with Java and C. I've been on a mission to code everyday. I'm an Android junkie and also a big fan of the Mac. I like to describe myself as a minimalist. "Design is not just what it looks like, but how it works"  - *Steve Jobs*, is one of my mantras.

<br/>

I love <a href="https://www.facebook.com/var7photography" target="_blank">photography</a>. The other passion being Golf. I now shoot in the high 70s having picked up the game at the <a href="http://www.hyderabadgolfclub.co.in/HGA/Hyderabad_Golf_Club_Home.html" target="_blank">Hyderabad Golf Club</a> aged 9 years old. My color code is Red and Black. I'm an ardent Manchester United supporter. Being an Indian, loving cricket is probably in my genes. I'm a total book-worm, with Fantasy the favorite genre. I'm currently reading the *Wheel of Time* series by *Robert Jordan*. 

<br/>

I want to make the world a better place for future generations.
