The goal of the project was to create a low-cost, compact demonstration kit for the drip irrigation company <strong>Driptech</strong>, headquartered in India. The <strong>DiscoverDrip Demo Kit</strong> is a demonstration tool created for Driptech, a company that produces low-cost, high-quality drip irrigation systems for small-plot farmers in developing countries. Driptech sales officers will use the Demo Kit during marketing activities to generate interest in drip irrigation among farmers and demonstrate some of the defining features of company’s products. The Demo Kit, composed of a self-standing, durable plastic bag connected to the Driptech takeoff valve and driptape, is simple to use, compact for easy transportation and costs only about $1 to manufacture.
